#+DESCRIPTION: Use the Spacemacs icon for starting Emacs.

Recently I really got into using
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] and I like it a lot. With
the next release this great Emacs configuration has an official logo. So I
thought that it would be a good idea to use it as an Icon in Ubuntu Unity.

#+CAPTION: Spacemacs as an Application in Unity
#+ATTR_LaTeX: scale=0.75
#+LABEL: fig:unity_spacemacs

If you also want to do this just create the file =~/.local/share/applications/spacemacs.desktop=
with the following content:

#+begin_src bash
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Spacemacs
GenericName=Text Editor
Comment=Edit text
MimeType=text/english;text/plain;text/x-makefile;text/x-c++hdr;text/x-c++src;text/x-chdr;text/x-csrc;text/x-java;text/x-moc;text/x-pascal;text/x-tcl;text/x-tex;application/x-shellscript;text/x-c;text/x-c++;
Exec=emacs %F
Icon=/home/cp/.emacs.d/core/banners/img/spacemacs.png
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Development;TextEditor;
StartupWMClass=Emacs
#+end_src

Make sure you set the Icon path to your =spacemacs.png= location.

Edit: It was pointed out to me that putting the =.desktop= into
=~/.local/share/applications= is a cleaner.
