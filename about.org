#+AUTHOR: Christoph Paulik

Hi, my name is Christoph Paulik. This is my personal blog. The topics
I write about are mostly computer and science related.
I'm a researcher interested in remote
sensing, data wrangling, open science and reproducibility.

This blog is based on the great
[[http://house.github.io/martin]["Martin"]] theme by
[[http://twitter.com/house][Allison House]].

It is generated with [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]] and
written in [[http://orgmode.org/][Emacs Org mode]].
